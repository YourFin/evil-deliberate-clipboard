#+TITLE: Evil deliberate cliboard mode

*Note:* This package requires Emacs *25* or later

* Recommendations:
The following line:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(setq-default save-interprogram-paste-before-kill t)
#+END_SRC
Has emacs hold on to clipboard contents in the kill ring before things get sent
to the system clipboard. It is *highly* recommended to set this with
evil-deliberate-clipboard-mode, and not doing so may lead to unexpected, if
"correct", behaviour.

This package is built with the system clipboard in mind, i.e.
~select-enable-clipboard~ is not ~nil~ (this is the default behavior). It will
still function without the system clipboard, though.
